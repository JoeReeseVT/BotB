# Battle of the Bands

Battle of the Bands is a local two-player competitive brawler - with a twist! The two players square off as competing musicians on a stage, duking it out in a no holds-barred brawl, and their attacks only deal damage if they're on beat! Combos require not just the sequencing of buttons, but the use of different rhythms! Players can time their attacks to the music being played. Different "difficulties" consist of the game's soundtrack being played at different speeds, or in different time signatures, modifying what attacks the players can execute.
